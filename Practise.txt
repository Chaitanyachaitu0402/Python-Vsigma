Introduction to the Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib

#Numpy:

->Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in the Python
->Numpy is a python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects

#Numpy Array:

->An array is a grid of values ana it contains information about the raw data,how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element
->There are different types of the array that are as follows:
    ->1D Array
    ->2D Array
    ->3D Array
    ->Multidimensional Array

#Numpy vs Python List:

->Consumes less memory
->fast as compared to the python List
->Convenient to use

Installation Numpy:
->pip install Numpy

Import Numpy:
->Import numpy as np

#Special Numpy Array:

->Array filled with 0'scientific
->Array filled with 1'scientific
->Create an empty array
->An Array with a range of elements
->Array diagonal element filled with 1'scientific
->Create an array with values that are spaced linearly in a specfied interval

#Create Numpy Arrays with Random Numbers

->rand()
    the function is used to generate a random value between 0 to 1.
->randn()
    the function is used to generate a random value close to zero. This may return positive or negative numbers as well.
->ranf()
    the function for doing random sampling in numpy. it returns an array of specified shape and fills it with random floats in the half open interval [0.0,1.0)
->randint()
    the function is used to generate a random number between the given range        

#Datatypes in Numpy Array

->int8
->int16
->int32
->int64
->float8
->float16
->float32
->boolean
->unsigned

#Arthmetic Operations in the Numpy Arrays

->Addtion
->Subtraction
->Divison
->Module Divison
->Reciprocal
